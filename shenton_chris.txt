iSat: for NASA SMD: Satellite orbit calculations and interactive real-time 3D visualization, runs entirely in the browser with JavaScript



Bio (long):

Chris Shenton (@shentonfreude) started working at NASA GSFC doing
robotics and AI, moved into the Center networking group, and later
transferred to NASA HQ where he continued doing large systems and
network security; he was given a few years off for good behavior and
worked in DotCom until it went bust. He's been working on applications
the past few years, mostly in Python but recently in JavaScript.
Chris is an open source and UNIX bigot, helps lead the DCpython meetup
community, and runs Koansys, LLC.

Abstract (long):

iSat is an interactive real-time visualization tool for viewing
satellites, their locations relative to the Earth, and their orbits.
To be widely accessible, it was written in JavaScript and all the
calculations and graphics run entirely in the browser. The application
is fun to work with, and initial responses from users has been very
encouraging. It was developed for the NASA Science Mission Directorate
and succeeds the JTrack-3D applet which has been very popular with the
Education community. It's making its public debut here at SXSW and you
can find it under http://science.nasa.gov/
